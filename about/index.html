                We were born and raised at the base of the Cottonwood Canyons and have made these canyons our home. As
                active outdoor enthusiasts we wanted to create events where others could enjoy these beautiful
                mountains…this is how Vigor Utah was born.

            <h4><i class="fa fa-flag"></i> FIRST THINGS FIRST</h4>
            <p>
                Our goal at Vigor Utah, is America and Utah first. It is our intention to have 100% of all products
                provided at Vigor events to be made locally. This includes: sponsors, shirts manufactured, medals
                manufactured (by <a href="http://dynabuckle.com/" class="linkOverDark" target="_blank">Dynabuckle</a>),
                local businesses supporting the finish line, etc. This may keep our product (bling) smaller, but please
                keep in mind it cost us more to bring Utah’s own products to you. Our hope is you would prefer to
                support our local economy with a smaller finisher medal, than support other nations by sporting the
                biggest medal out there. Either way, Vigor Utah appreciates your support!

                            day before me. You found some special people to be willing to get up so early and take care
                            of a bunch of runners. So keep the early start time. It was awesome to be home by 8 and in

                            BEAUTIFUL, the police patrol was appreciated, the medals were great, the shirts bright and
                            fantastic. I had the BEST time ever. I am so looking forward to next year and doing the HALF

                            of many road races, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Vigor Utah. You provided an incredible
                            race day experience. Well organized, well-coordinated and lots of fun. I came from San Diego
                            to race and I can truly say that my fellow participants were among the friendliest, creating
                            the most supportive climate I have ever enjoyed on a race. Even a police officer gave me a
                            "high five"!
                            Well done. I will be back next year!
                        </p>
