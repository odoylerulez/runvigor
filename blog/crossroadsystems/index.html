    Do you experience pain, inflammation, cramping, digestive problems, arthritis, allergies, lack of energy, etc.? Let's take a look at why we experience these health issues and what we can do to achieve optimal health and nutrition.
</p>
<!--more-->
<h4><u>Health Begins On a Cellular Level</u></h4>
<p>
    How do you know you are getting stronger? You lift heavier weights. How do you know you are getting faster? Your times are decreasing, right? How do you know if you are getting healthier? You check how you feel and look from the inside out. Our health and nutrition starts on a cellular level based on what fuel (diet) we are putting into our tanks (stomach) to be digested and utilized. Poor eating habits, busy lifestyles, and/or poor health conditions affect us from the inside out, which in return, affect our mood, energy, strength, and mental clarity among other things. It is vital to our health that it begins with digestion.
</p>
<h4><u>Digestion vs. Indigestion</u></h4>
<p>
    “You are what you eat” is a common phrase we hear. Have you heard that it’s not what you ingest that is important but what you digest that matters most? We are encouraged to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, but if we are not digesting what we are eating, we may have some health issues. What we ingest SHOULD be digested and used for nutrition. What we ingest that does not get digested, we store. This can, in return, lead to many health issues we see today such as acid reflux, heart burn, high cholesterol, hypertension, inflammation, fatigue, cramping, diabetes, heavy weight gain, and others.
</p>
<p>
    Enzymes and probiotics are essential for overall digestion, immunity, health and nutrition. Enzymes are catalysts we naturally store in our pancreas and other glands in our bodies for the breakdown of foods and other metabolic functions. We can also find enzymes in raw foods. If you can remember the last time you bit into an apple and left it sitting on the counter for a period of time, what happened to that apple? Did it stay the same shape and color? It actually began to break down immediately. Instinctively food enzymes start to breakdown the food naturally. Once we cook raw foods over 118 degrees Fahrenheit, we destroy these whole-food enzymes and rely heavily on our pancreas to produce enzymes to digest our foods. These enzymes created by our pancreas are limited... In other words, once we use them we lose them. So what can you do to help your digestion?
</p>
<h4><u>Vitamins & Minerals</u></h4>
<p>
    So your doctor told you to take some vitamins. As you stand in the vitamin aisle at the grocery store, how do you know which ones to buy? Aren’t they all the same? Wouldn’t the least expensive bottle be just as good as the most expensive bottle? Aren't \"Natural\" or \"Organic better quality? These are common questions when trying to shop for a good quality supplement. So how do you know if the supplement is good, and are you truly getting what you want in these synthetic forms of vitamins? Go grab your bottle of Vitamin C from your cupboard right now and look at the ingredients label. Most Vitamin C sold in stores is labeled as “Ascorbic Acid” or “Ascorbate.” Does that sound natural to you? Have you ever wondered why some “vitamins” are difficult to spell or pronounce? Have you ever thought to yourself, “I can’t even tell a difference when I take these...”? So are these really helping? How can you find vitamins and minerals that are effective?
</p>
<h4><u>Cleaner Fuel, Better Performance</u></h4>
<p>
    We have vital organs that function properly, if we fuel them. Our liver and kidneys have 900+ functions together and are detrimental to our health and wellness. Their greatest functions come from filtering waste from our bodies. Just as we periodically clean our car and air filters for cleaner fuel and air, respectively, we must also regularly clean our body's filters. Our liver and kidneys need to be cleaned often in order for our body to maintain a healthy fuel system. So how can you clean these body systems?
</p>
<h4><u>A Solution</u></h4>
<p>
    We have asked the questions: What can you do to help your digestion? How can you find vitamins and minerals that are effective and of good quality? How can you clean your liver and kidneys? We believe we have found the solution at Crossroads. Crossroads is a health-education company designed around increasing, even optimizing, the core of personal health and performance. They have formulated key products to support healthy digestion by providing key enzymes and probiotics for proper digestion and gut health. There supplements are truly natural, plant based products and have been formulated in a way that each product comes with its own delivery system that allows you to get the most out of every capsule you take. This is real nutrition with life changing effects.

By the way I was whining about the super early start time and bus ride. Then I saw all the wonderful volunteers and the coffee guys that probably started the day before me. You found some special people to be willing to get up so early and take care of a bunch of runners. So keep the early start time. It was awesome to be home by 8 and in the bath soaking my aches away. Take care</p>

Bathrooms too. The downhill walk not too bad. Well marked and staffed course. Loved it. Your volunteers ROCKED. Pictures-well done.</p>

I recently started running in December and decided that I was done with the 5K's and chose your 10K for my first. The course was BEAUTIFUL, the police patrol was appreciated, the medals were great, the shirts bright and fantastic. I had the BEST time ever. I am so looking forward to next year and doing the HALF marathon. I was lucky enough to place 1st place for my age (hope there was more than one in my age group...haha)...Either way, had amazing time. Thanks so much for helping me enjoy my running even more. I am HIGHLY recommending your races!</p>

I enjoyed it very much and enjoyed my PR and winning my age group even more!!  I really liked how you were able to get Solitude to open their building for us to stay in rather than have to sit outside in the cold for over an hour.  That was great!  Though I am not a coffee drinker, having coffee and hot chocolate available was also a nice touch.</p>

The Vigor Big Cottonwood Canyon race on 11 May was one of the best I have run. I will run this race again. The logistics were first class. The post-race scene was like a much larger race. You have a good thing going on here and I will bring friends next year.</p>

                                The races were well run, the Hyatt was a great race partner (!) and we have nothing but praise. Downhill running is painful for a flat surface South Florida runner, ( as you warned me) but the view was so gorgeous and the racers so friendly, and the sponsors so awesome ...  It was worth the pain. I have run many races but this was the best race I have ever run in terms of the overall experience!
                                We will be talking about this race for the rest of our lives. Seriously.  Thank you!

You provided an incredible race day experience.  Well organized, well-coordinated and lots of fun.  I came from San Diego to race and I can truly say that my fellow participants were among the friendliest, creating the most supportive climate I have ever enjoyed on a race.  Even a police officer gave me a "high five"!
                                Well done.  I will be back next year!
