By the way I was whining about the super early start time and bus ride. Then I saw all the wonderful volunteers and the coffee guys that probably started the day before me. You found some special people to be willing to get up so early and take care of a bunch of runners. So keep the early start time. It was awesome to be home by 8 and in the bath soaking my aches away. Take care</p>

I recently started running in December and decided that I was done with the 5K's and chose your 10K for my first. The course was BEAUTIFUL, the police patrol was appreciated, the medals were great, the shirts bright and fantastic. I had the BEST time ever. I am so looking forward to next year and doing the HALF marathon. I was lucky enough to place 1st place for my age (hope there was more than one in my age group...haha)...Either way, had amazing time. Thanks so much for helping me enjoy my running even more. I am HIGHLY recommending your races!</p>

I enjoyed it very much and enjoyed my PR and winning my age group even more!!  I really liked how you were able to get Solitude to open their building for us to stay in rather than have to sit outside in the cold for over an hour.  That was great!  Though I am not a coffee drinker, having coffee and hot chocolate available was also a nice touch.</p>

The course was perfect and I thought this seemed like the most organized and well put together race I've been to. I would definitely like to see more races similar to this. Thanks for a great experience!</p>

The Vigor Big Cottonwood Canyon race on 11 May was one of the best I have run. I will run this race again. The logistics were first class. The post-race scene was like a much larger race. You have a good thing going on here and I will bring friends next year.</p>

                                The races were well run, the Hyatt was a great race partner (!) and we have nothing but praise. Downhill running is painful for a flat surface South Florida runner, ( as you warned me) but the view was so gorgeous and the racers so friendly, and the sponsors so awesome ...  It was worth the pain. I have run many races but this was the best race I have ever run in terms of the overall experience!
                                We will be talking about this race for the rest of our lives. Seriously.  Thank you!

You provided an incredible race day experience.  Well organized, well-coordinated and lots of fun.  I came from San Diego to race and I can truly say that my fellow participants were among the friendliest, creating the most supportive climate I have ever enjoyed on a race.  Even a police officer gave me a "high five"!
                                Well done.  I will be back next year!
