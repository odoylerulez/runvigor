                                        Area where there will be portable restrooms. Starting elevation is about 5300.
                                        The first two miles of the 5K offer varying grades to the mouth of the canyon.
                                        Once out of the canyon, runners will follow cones (through parking lot) and will
                                        be directed down a ramp. The path will lead runners under Wasatch Blvd and
                                        continue to hug the Big Cottonwood Creek for about 3/4 mile. While crossing at
                                        Big Cottonwood Canyon Road take note of the Historic

                                        Building. Runners will be descending 591 feet total, with a finishing elevation
                                        of approximately 4700 feet. At the finish line runners will be greeted with a
                                        finisher medal, and be able to enjoy food, music, and massage. Invite the whole

                                started the day before me. You found some special people to be willing to get up so
                                early and take care of a bunch of runners. So keep the early start time. It was awesome

                                praise. Downhill running is painful for a flat surface South Florida runner, ( as you
                                warned me) but the view was so gorgeous and the racers so friendly, and the sponsors so
                                awesome ... It was worth the pain. I have run many races but this was the best race I
                                have ever run in terms of the overall experience!
                                We will be talking about this race for the rest of our lives. Seriously. Thank you!

                                veteran of many road races, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Vigor Utah. You provided
                                an incredible race day experience. Well organized, well-coordinated and lots of fun. I
                                came from San Diego to race and I can truly say that my fellow participants were among
                                the friendliest, creating the most supportive climate I have ever enjoyed on a race.
                                Even a police officer gave me a "high five"!
                                Well done. I will be back next year!
